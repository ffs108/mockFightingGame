Simple fighting game using JavaScript and the canvas element in HTML. OOP practice as well as dynamic input practice. Mostly learned how to use outside resources and incorporate them into my own code such as the sprites. Learned a bit about hit boxes and how they can also be used outside of a fighting hame such as calculating when an object comes in the general vicinity of another, and general concepts of collision detection. These principles are important in other fields and having a basis of understanding them was a good experience.
